Chapter 806: A Dance of Light and Shadow


After returning to the dancing hall; Sunny saw it in a new light; His perception had shifted; making everything seem darker and more dangerous; He had already been apprehensive about the crowd of guests; but now; every one of them looked like a potential threat;

Mordret might have said that he was not planning to do anything and had just come to take a look, but could the banished prince be trusted? As far as Sunny was concerned, the lunatic could have been on his way to publicly assassinate one of his relatives, or slaughter as many as he could, right now;

Much worse. he could be hiding inside of anyone; Every guest was a potential host; Every mundane human. every Awakened. every Master  none of them were beyond suspicion;

Even Saints were not off the list, perhaps;

Sunny suppressed a groan.

'Curse it all '

There were two carriers of Divine Aspects in the world that had made it their life's goal to destroy the great clan Valor at all costs. And now, both of them were in this building!

Even if nothing happened. the threat alone made him itchy;

The great hall where dozens of beautiful pairs danced suddenly did not look as splendid;

Turning around. Sunny looked at Nephis. lingered for a few moments. and then walked in her direction with steady steps;

As he came close, he offered her a hand and asked;;;

"Shall we dance?"

Neph looked at him in confusion for a couple of seconds, then shrugged and placed her hand in his.

Together. they walked to the middle of the hall; Sunny put his second hand on her waist. while she put hers on his shoulder; Suddenly. they were extremely close to each other;

Sunny's heart skipped a beat.

 It was in moments like this one that he missed having two;

Without wasting any time; Sunny led Neph into a dance; It wasn't too hard  he just had to listen to the music and repeat what the other dancers were doing; With his proficiency in Shadow Dance; understanding the logic and cadence of their movements was incredibly easy for him;

Although Sunny was dancing for the first time in his life; he looked more comfortable and adept at it than most of the guests; Changing Star seemed like a natural; too; Perhaps it was due to her own combat mastery; or perhaps she had received lessons as an heiress of a Legacy clan; In any case; almost instantly after they started the dance; the pair caught a lot of admiring stares;

Sunny did not care; He had much bigger problems on his mind;

Trying to not let her closeness affect him too much and failing at it. he waited for a bit and gathered his thoughts. Finally. Sunny said. his voice drowned by the music and the hum of the great hall:

"I've been meaning to ask "

The time to hide his head in the sand was over;

Nephis silently raised an eyebrow, prompting him to continue.

"What, exactly, are you planning to do today? You know that Valor won't take no for an answer. They want to have all of us, but if that is not possible, they'll only settle for getting at least one. That way, they'll be assured that the rest of us won't join a rival faction. So  which one of us is going to become a retainer of the great clan Valor?"

Changing Star lingered for a while, allowing him to lead her in the dance. Her hand rested easily on his shoulder.

After a few steps, she suddenly asked:

"You don't really understand, do you?"

Sunny did not frown, but his eyes suddenly became darker.

"I don't? What is it that you think I don't understand?"

A somber expression slowly appeared on her face.

"Valor and Song are not rival factions, Sunny. They're warcamps."

As they spun under the light of beautiful chandeliers, she leaned even closer and said:

"I've studied the facts for a long time after returning to the waking world. The ripples caused by the death of Saint Cormac, the subtle machinations that happen in the darkness, the growing imbalance of power between Bastion and Ravenheart  even the timing of Seishan challenging the Second Nightmare. It all paints a clear picture."

A slight scowl appeared on Sunny's face.

"What are you trying to say?"

Nephis sighed.

"I am trying to make you see that the conflict between the great clans has grown into something more than mere disagreement. They are at war  or rather, they will be soon."

Sunny felt her hand growing tense in his own.

"War? Wait  what does a war between great clans even look like?"

Changing Star shook her head.

"Something like that has never happened before. So  who knows? Three things are certain, however. It will be hidden. It will be bloody. It will claim the lives of many people."

He suddenly felt cold.

'Damned Legacies  Antarctica is about to fall, and they choose that exact moment to lunge at each other's throats! Bastards!'

Sunny remained silent for several steps, and then looked at Nephis intently:

"Alright. But what does it have to do with us?"

She suddenly gripped his shoulder tighter and met his gaze. Cold, dangerous white sparks were dancing in her eyes.

"Don't you see? It has everything to do with us."

Sunny stopped himself from snarling.

"I don't! Nephis  whether the great clans are embroiled into a secret war or not does not change anything. You are still too small and weak to openly oppose them. Please, tell me that you understand that. You were the one who said that the  that these people are too strong. That their power is too absolute."

Changing Star stared at him for a while, her face turning impassive. After a few moments of silence, she said:

"I remember. I understand."

She looked down, and then added:

"Which is why  which is why the answer to your question might not be what you want to hear, Sunny. You asked me which one of us will become a member of the great clan."

Nephis raised her head and looked him straight in the eyes. Then, she said evenly:

"It's me. I will join Valor."
